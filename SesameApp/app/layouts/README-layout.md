The layouts directory doesn’t directly align with any single goal but the purpose here is to give us an idea of different experiences a user may expect in our app — it’s mostly for developer happiness and ease of understanding. For example an app may have an Auth layout, an Admin layout, and a general App layout. The directories themselves are organized very similarly to the app/components/ directory.

In a layout I’ll normally setup the global navigation for that layout (like tabs or a menu).
